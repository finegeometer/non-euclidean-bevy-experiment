# Non-euclidean Bevy

What does it take to implement a non-euclidean game in Bevy? This project aims to find out.

`bevy_euclidean_example` and `bevy_non_euclidean_example` are implementations of the same project, except the shape of space is different. In the former, space is flat. In the latter, it is positively curved.

Every other crate is a replacement for something in Bevy that only works with Euclidean geometry.

## Controls

WASD, Space, Shift to move.
